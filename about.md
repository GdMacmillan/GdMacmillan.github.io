# About Gordon MacMillan


I am a machine learning engineer and data scientist with prior work experience in mechanical engineering. As an engineer I began to gain interest in the field of deep learning and statistical science in 2016. I have always hoped to learn programming in more depth than I did when I was in college at the University of Colorado Boulder. The Galvanize data science immersive program presented an opportunity to extend my programming knowledge and gain experience in computer science and statistics.


My research interests lie in the fields of machine learning and Bayesian statistics. Specifically, I develop models to discover feature structure in data, including cluster structure, using classic statistical methods and deep learning.


I apply these methods to problems in healthcare, business and human behavior, including human categorization and human interactions.


Prior work experience consists of machine design and engineering of automated equipment and aerostructures design and testing.
