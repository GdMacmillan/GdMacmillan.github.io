## Purpose

We are going to talk about a topic often talked about in the context of Python. With many well supported packages and a vibrant community of developers around them, why wouldn't we use Python? Well, the simplicity and user friendly syntax of Julia along with the ability to run as fast as C at compile time, would seme like a good reason for one. So how good is Julia when the task is understanding the naturual language and it's subtleties? We are going to take a look below. Code for the following can be found here:
